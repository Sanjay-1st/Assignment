    <h1>8.Write a JavaScript program to compute the new ratings between two or more opponents
        using the Elo rating system. It takes an array of pre-ratings and returns an array containing
        post-ratings. The array should be ordered from best performer to worst performer (winner
        -> loser).</h1>
